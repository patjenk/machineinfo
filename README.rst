pyGawain
========

This library is named after `Sir Gawain`_. There is no particular reason he was
chosen as the inspiration.

This library is an attempt to be a python equivalent to chef's `ohai`_ library.
This functionality is provided in several parts inside `salt`_ but it is not
available as it's own library.
